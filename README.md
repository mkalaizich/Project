# Movie Reminder
###Final Project of the HTML5 bootcamp. 

Movie Reminder is an app which lists the movies you want to watch,  lets you set alarms to watch movies later and filter them by runtime and genre.

###Instalation

In the order to run this app, you should clone this repository in your device and open the index.html file with your favourite browser.
We recommend Mozilla Firefox, as if you want to run Movie reminder with a different server you must first run a server locally.

###How to Use

Click on the manage tab to add new movies or delete some of the listed ones.

Before adding a movie you will see it's poster and plot description. If the movie displayed it's not the one you're looking for, specify it's release year.
Be sure to write the movie title as accurately as possible.

You can set an alarm to remind you which movie you wanted to watch in a partiular day!
